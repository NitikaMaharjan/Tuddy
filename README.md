# My First React Project â€“ Learning the Basics

This repository contains my **first hands-on project** built with React. It was developed as part of my learning journey to understand the fundamentals of React development, including components, state management, and routing.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced and understood the following core React concepts:

- Creating **function-based components**
- **Importing and exporting** modules
- Handling **DOM events** like clicks
- Using the **`useState` hook** for state management
- Updating component state and re-rendering UI
- Integrating **Bootstrap** for styling
- Displaying **alert messages** based on user interactions
- Setting up **routing with `react-router-dom`**

## Technologies Used
- React
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- React Router DOM
- VS Code

## Screenshots

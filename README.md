# My First React Project â€“ Learning the Basics

This repository contains my first hands-on project while learning React, with a focus on function-based components. It covers importing and exporting modules, handling events, using the useState hook, updating state, integrating Bootstrap for styling, displaying alert messages, and setting up routing with react-router-dom.
